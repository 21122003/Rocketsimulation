# Rocketsimulation
This project simulates rocket management and launch using object-oriented programming and graphical simulation. Users can create rockets, store data in a text file, display rocket details, and simulate launches with animated ascent based on fuel levels. An interactive menu allows for rocket creation, viewing details, and running simulations
